Description: A software platform for processing vast amounts of data
 Hadoop is a software platform that lets one easily write and
 run applications that process vast amounts of data.
 .
 Here's what makes Hadoop especially useful:
  * Scalable: Hadoop can reliably store and process petabytes.
  * Economical: It distributes the data and processing across clusters
                of commonly available computers. These clusters can number
                into the thousands of nodes.
  * Efficient: By distributing the data, Hadoop can process it in parallel
               on the nodes where the data is located. This makes it
               extremely rapid.
  * Reliable: Hadoop automatically maintains multiple copies of data and
              automatically redeploys computing tasks based on failures.
 .
 Hadoop implements MapReduce, using the Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS).
 MapReduce divides applications into many small blocks of work. HDFS creates
 multiple replicas of data blocks for reliability, placing them on compute
 nodes around the cluster. MapReduce can then process the data where it is
 located.

Description: Task Tracker for Hadoop
 The Task Tracker is the Hadoop service that accepts MapReduce tasks and
 computes results. Each node in a Hadoop cluster that should be doing
 computation should run a Task Tracker.

Description: Job Tracker for Hadoop
 The jobtracker is a central service which is responsible for managing
 the tasktracker services running on all nodes in a Hadoop Cluster.
 The jobtracker allocates work to the tasktracker nearest to the data
 with an available work slot.
